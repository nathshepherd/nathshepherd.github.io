        Hi, I'm Nathan! ðŸ‘‹
      </Heading>
      <ProfileSection>
        I'm a software engineer at <a href={CANVA_URL} rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Canva</a> with a passion for front-end and software development!
        <br />
        Ever since I was little, it has been a lifelong goal to constantly
        challenge myself with new ideas and experiences from the world around
        me. From being hooked on problem-solving computer games as a kid, to
        learning languages like Typescript in my spare time, I've found personal
        joy in developing software that people will not only use but also enjoy.
        I hope to further explore this passion by working on products that
        impact the daily lives of millions worldwide!
